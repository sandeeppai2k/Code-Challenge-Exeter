Web Scraping

Web-Scraping.py contains the entire code. I have first defined functions. 
Then, the functions are called sequentially. The output is printed and it is also written to text files.

Learn Log.Docx includes the answers to the questions and a block diagram.

I have also included the output text files I obtained.
